Use comments and explanations in the notes and scripts to guide your markers thinking. As regards
 the features, I would agree that they can form the basis of the variable names, but in terms of 
a gold star perfect solution, I would point out they contain errors that don't make sense in terms
 of the documentation (bodybody) have characters that are technically illegal in variable names 
and would cause problems in formulas (-()) and can be a little cryptic just looking at them

The codebook for this course project should include the name of each variable (after any tidying) 
and a brief definition of its purpose at a minimum. The other sections you should have in a good 
codebook are an overview section about the source of the data as well as a synopsis, a data 
dictionary section explaining any naming conventions used for the variables and the aforementioned
 variable names and definitions. The codebook must provide enough information about the tidy 
dataset you are submitting so another person reading the codebook would understand the contents 
of the tidydata dataset file(s). There is no requirement that the codebook meet the ICPSR 
standard though it is a good basis for a template for real-life data analysis projects in the 
absence of a style guide established by your organisation. Take this course project seriously 
because the skills developed in this course will be especially useful in the Reproducible 
Research course in which you have to rely on the provided codebook to maximise the value of the 
raw data.
